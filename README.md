### Hi there, I'm Ryvel. Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m software engineering undergraduate student who is eager to learn new things, as well as, very enthusiastic to overcome obstacles. Most of the projects that i have done, are school projects. Like, simple android applications and websites. Personally, i really enjoy to become a front-end developer, since, i followed my passion in a core of UI designing and prototyping.
